Morphological Operators for ImageJ
You probably obtained these plugins and macros via Fiji with the "Morphology" 
update site selected, or downloaded the plugin collection as a single zip file 
from: http://www.mecourse.com/landinig/software/software.html

In that site you will also find documentation about the morphology collection 
as well as any new releases. In Fiji you should get any updates as part of the 
Update Fiji process.

This is my collection of ImageJ plugins to perform various morphological 
operations. All plugins are recordable. Some macros that make use of those 
plugins are also included. The java files are included in the jar file.
While most macros were written to deal with white regions, the plugins, deal 
with both, black or white regions (this means that the macros can be easily 
modified to deal with black regions too).

Please reference these plugins in your publications as:

ImageJ User and Developer Conference, Luxembourg, 6-7 November, 2008. p116-121.
